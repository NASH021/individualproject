        <h1>Painting is just another way of keeping diary</h1>
        
        <p>Djordje Pusic is described as one of the Serbian greatest colourist. 
        Dr Milan Konjovic calls him the painter of the wheat fields, vast plains,
        Vojvodina's urban views, and Mediterranean holiday scenery,
        whose works constitute an important reference point</p>
    
        <h2>Painting is self-discovery. Every good artist paints what he is</h2>
        
        <p>Djordje's mature style of painting is characterised by thick layers
        of paint. He resorted to pastels in the years after Bosnian War, 
        when there was a shortage of oil paints. Later on, he returned to oils,
        layering them on the surface in thicker layers than ever -
        this presents quite a challenge when cleaning some of the paintings. 
        The Byzantine phase of his last years is characterised by thinner layers
        of paint, with patches of unpainted surface</p>
